# Student-directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at the Villains Academy.
Learning the fundamentals of Ruby with a step by step process on scripting:

## How to use
```shell
git clone git@github.com:mandyvuong/student-directory.git
cd student-directory
ruby directory.rb file.csv
```
file.csv is optional

## Additional exercises
Exercises to practice the fundamentals of Ruby.
The following was extended from [this script](https://github.com/mandyvuong/student-directory/commit/f7ab497268c6a75420f39072db9aab0092be9272)
1. Modify the program to print a number before the name of each student, e.g. "1. Dr. Hannibal Lecter"? [link](https://github.com/mandyvuong/student-directory/commit/986a443d75197859ac8a5d7a6a4ad04eecf7dd16)
2. Modify your program to only print the students whose name begins with a specific letter [link](https://github.com/mandyvuong/student-directory/commit/5b7c66d341b6f4fe5d5e4c016c7727f3fd8c5d67)
3. Modify your program to only print the students whose name is shorter than 12 characters [link](https://github.com/mandyvuong/student-directory/commit/32bd9eb392a65bcf6f235bc708f195fbc2547d84)
4. Rewrite the each() method that prints all students using while or until control flow methods[link](https://github.com/mandyvuong/student-directory/commit/a40131481fc8e72fa9f3ce95c289b148ad1a0d2e)
5. Code only works with the student name and cohort. Add more information: hobbies, country of birth, etc [link](https://github.com/mandyvuong/student-directory/commit/70baf454c6c900faa4045920556295d9c6ea4c1a)
6. Using method center() of the String class works to make the output beautifully aligned [link](https://github.com/mandyvuong/student-directory/commit/e7902b132f6e0864cd7e37d911f10dbdbcfe1355)
